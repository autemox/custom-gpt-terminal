# custom-gpt-terminal

This custom gpt4 terminal acts like a normal gpt4 terminal but as messages leave context window they are summarized to minimize context loss.

Using Summarize-Folder, you can also upload programming projects or other folders of data and it will produce summary of each file in one copy-pastable unit, with a focus on key variables and class structures that can be fed back to llm to provide context about projects.

This custom gpt4 terminal can also utilize midjourney to create images.  Note it was written before dalle and midjourney official api existed, and uses an unofficial midjourney api that will stop working someday.
